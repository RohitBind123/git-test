# üìù Git Workflow Summary

This file summarizes the basic Git workflow, from initializing a repository to pushing it to a remote server.

## 1. Initialization üå±

### `git init`
- **Purpose:** To create a new Git repository.
- **How it works:** It creates a hidden `.git` directory in your current folder. This directory contains all the necessary files and metadata for Git to track your project's history.

## 2. Checking the Status üîç

### `git status`
- **Purpose:** To see the current state of your repository.
- **What it shows:**
    - Which files are modified.
    - Which files are "staged" (ready to be committed).
    - Which files are "untracked" (new files that Git doesn't know about yet).

## 3. Staging Changes üì•

### `git add <file>`
- **Purpose:** To add file changes to the "staging area". The staging area is a snapshot of the changes you want to include in your next commit.
- **Keywords:**
    - `add`: The command to stage changes.
    - `<file>`: The name of the file you want to stage. You can also use `.` to stage all modified and new files in the current directory.

## 4. Committing Changes üíæ

### `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
- **Purpose:** To save your staged changes to the project's history. A commit is a permanent snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.
- **Keywords:**
    - `commit`: The command to create a new commit.
    - `-m`: A flag that stands for "message". It allows you to provide a commit message directly from the command line.
    - `"Your commit message"`: A brief description of the changes you made.

## 5. Viewing History üìú

### `git log`
- **Purpose:** To see the history of commits in your repository.
- **What it shows:** A list of all commits, with their unique ID (hash), author, date, and commit message.

### `git diff`
- **Purpose:** To see the exact changes you've made to your files since the last commit.
- **How it works:** It shows the differences between your working directory and the last commit.

## 6. Working with Remotes ‚òÅÔ∏è

### `git remote add <name> <url>`
- **Purpose:** To connect your local repository to a remote repository (e.g., on GitHub).
- **Keywords:**
    - `remote`: The command for managing remote connections.
    - `add`: The subcommand to add a new remote.
    - `<name>`: A nickname for the remote repository. `origin` is the standard convention.
    - `<url>`: The URL of the remote repository.
- **Example:** `git remote add origin https://github.com/RohitBind123/git-test.git`

### `git remote -v`
- **Purpose:** To list all the remote repositories you have configured.
- **Keywords:**
    - `-v`: A flag that stands for "verbose". It shows the URLs for each remote.

## 7. Pushing Changes ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

### `git push -u <remote> <branch>`
- **Purpose:** To upload your committed changes from your local branch to a remote repository.
- **Keywords:**
    - `push`: The command to upload changes.
    - `-u`: A flag that stands for `--set-upstream`. It creates a link between your local branch and the remote branch. This allows you to use `git push` (without arguments) in the future.
    - `<remote>`: The name of the remote you're pushing to (e.g., `origin`).
    - `<branch>`: The name of the branch you're pushing (e.g., `master`).
- **Example:** `git push -u origin master`

## 8. Working with Branches üåø

Branches allow you to work on different features or fixes in isolation without affecting the main `master` branch.

### Scenario 1: Creating a New Branch Locally

This is the most common way to start new work.

1.  **Create and switch to a new branch:**
    ```bash
    git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
    ```
    *   This single command creates a new branch from your current branch and immediately switches to it.

2.  **Make your changes:**
    *   Modify your code, create new files, etc.

3.  **Add and commit your changes:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add new feature"
    ```

4.  **Push the new branch to the remote:**
    *   The first time you push a new branch, you need to set the "upstream" link.
    ```bash
    git push -u origin <your-branch-name>
    ```
    *   After this initial push, you can simply use `git push` for subsequent changes on this branch.

### Scenario 2: Branch Created on GitHub

If a branch is created directly on GitHub, you need to bring it to your local machine.

1.  **Fetch all remote changes:**
    *   This command downloads information about new branches from the remote repository without changing your local files.
    ```bash
    git fetch origin
    ```

2.  **Switch to the desired branch:**
    *   Git is smart. If you try to checkout a branch that exists on the remote but not locally, it will create a local copy for you and set it up to track the remote one.
    *   As an example, we used this to checkout the `new-test-branch` that was created on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git checkout new-test-branch
    ```

3.  **Make, add, and commit changes:**
    *   This process is the same as always.
    ```bash
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "Update README on new branch"
    ```

4.  **Push your changes:**
    *   Because the tracking relationship was already set up in the checkout step, you can just use the simple push command.
    ```bash
    git push
    ```

## 9. Other Important Concepts üí°

Here are a few other essential commands and concepts for using Git effectively.

### Updating Your Local Repository (`git pull`)

If other people are pushing changes to the remote repository, your local version will become outdated. `git pull` updates your current local branch with any new commits from the corresponding remote branch.

```bash
git pull origin master
```
*   This fetches the changes from the `master` branch on the `origin` remote and merges them into your current local branch. It's a combination of `git fetch` and `git merge`.

### Merging Branches (`git merge`)

Once you have finished working on a feature in a separate branch, you'll want to merge it back into your main branch (e.g., `master`).

1.  **Switch to the branch you want to merge into:**
    ```bash
    git checkout master
    ```
2.  **Run the merge command:**
    ```bash
    git merge <your-feature-branch>
    ```
*   This takes all the commits from `<your-feature-branch>` and integrates them into the `master` branch.

### Resolving Merge Conflicts ü§Ø

Sometimes, Git cannot automatically merge changes because the same lines of a file were changed on both branches. This is a **merge conflict**.

*   Git will mark the conflicted areas in the file like this:
    ```
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    // Code from your current branch
    =======
    // Code from the other branch
    >>>>>>> <other-branch-name>
    ```
*   To resolve the conflict, you must:
    1.  Open the file.
    2.  Manually edit the code to keep the changes you want.
    3.  Remove the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
    4.  Save the file.
    5.  `git add` the resolved file.
    6.  `git commit` to finalize the merge.

### Ignoring Files (`.gitignore`)

You often have files or directories that you don't want Git to ever track (e.g., log files, dependency folders like `node_modules`, build outputs).

*   Create a file named `.gitignore` in the root of your repository.
*   Add the names of files or folders you want to ignore, one per line.
*   Example `.gitignore` content:
    ```
    # Ignore dependency folders
    node_modules/

    # Ignore log files
    *.log

    # Ignore environment variables file
    .env
    ```

### Undoing Changes (A Quick Guide)

*   **Discard changes in a file (before staging):** To revert a file to how it was at the last commit.
    ```bash
    git checkout -- <file-name>
    ```
*   **Unstage a file (before committing):** To remove a file from the staging area.
    ```bash
    git reset HEAD <file-name>
    ```

## 10. Real-World Scenario: Fixing a 'Rejected' Push üö®

Just now, you encountered a very common error that we can use as a real-world example.

### The Problem: `! [rejected] (non-fast-forward)`

You tried to `git push`, but received an error message like this:

```
! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/...'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Use 'git pull' before pushing again.
```

**What it means:** This error happens when there are commits on the remote repository (e.g., on GitHub) that you don't have on your local machine. Git stops you from pushing because your changes would overwrite the history on the remote, potentially losing someone else's work.

### The Solution: Pull, Merge, and Push

Here is the exact step-by-step process we followed to solve it:

**Step 1: Pull the remote changes**

The first step is always to follow the hint Git gives you: `git pull`. This fetches the remote changes and tries to merge them with your local work.

```bash
git pull origin master
```

**Step 2: The Merge Conflict**

In our case, the `pull` command resulted in a new problem:

```
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

This happened because both our local machine and the remote repository had changes at the *exact same lines* in the `README.md` file. Git couldn't decide which version to keep, so it asked us to resolve it manually.

**Step 3: Resolve the Conflict Manually**

1.  **We opened the conflicted file (`README.md`).** Inside, we saw the conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
2.  **We analyzed the two versions.** The `HEAD` version (our local one) had all the new documentation sections we wanted. The remote version was missing them.
3.  **We edited the file to keep the correct version.** We deleted the conflict markers and the incorrect parts, leaving only the complete, correct text.
4.  **We saved the now-clean file.**

**Step 4: Finalize the Merge**

Once the file was fixed, we had to tell Git that the conflict was resolved.

1.  **Stage the resolved file:** This marks the conflict as resolved.
    ```bash
    git add README.md
    ```
2.  **Commit the merge:** This creates a new "merge commit" that combines both the local and remote histories.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/master'"
    ```
    *(Git often provides a default message for merge commits, which is usually fine to use.)*

**Step 5: Push Your Changes (Finally!)**

After the merge commit, our local `master` branch was finally ahead of the remote `origin/master` and contained all the changes from both sources. We were then able to push successfully.

```bash
git push origin master
```

This entire process (pull -> conflict -> resolve -> add -> commit -> push) is a fundamental part of collaborating with Git.
